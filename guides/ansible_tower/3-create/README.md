## Running a Job Template

Now that you’ve sucessfully created your Job Template, you are ready to launch it. Once you do, you will be redirected to a job screen which is refreshing in realtime showing you the status of the job.

### Step 1

Select TEMPLATES

**NOTE**: Alternative way to navigate to TEMPLATES:

If you haven't navigated away from the job templates creation page you can scroll down to see all existing job templates

### Step 4

Select LAUNCH ![Survey launch button](at_survey_launch.png)

### Step 5

Wait and watch the execution of the job.

One of the first things you will notice is the summary section.  This gives you details about your job such as who launched it, what playbook it's running, what the status is, i.e. pending, running, or complete. You’ll also notice the `apache_test_message` being passed in the field EXTRA VARIABLES in the text box on the left bottom side. To the right, you can view standard output; the same way you could if you were running `ansible-playbook` from the command line.

You can also click on each task in the standard output to get more details.

### Step 6

Once your job is sucessful, navigate to your new website:

```bash
http://<IP_of_node-1_or_node-2>
```

If all went well, you should see something like this, but with your own custom message:
