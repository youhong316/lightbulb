# Ansible Lightbulb - Ansible Engine Guide

This guide is part of lightbulb, a multi-purpose toolkit for effectively demonstrating Ansible's capabilities or providing informal trainings in various forms -- instructor-led, hands-on or self-paced.

The focus of this guide is on the set up and usage of Ansible Engine.

* [Exercise 3 - Using Variables, Loops, and Handlers](3-variables)
