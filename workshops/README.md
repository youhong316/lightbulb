# Ansible Workshops

The workshops are a collection of assignments for learning how to automate with Ansible. The workshops are introduced by the decks and are assigned to the students during the presentations.

The workshops are set up as exercises to be done by the participants, and are most suitable for smaller audiences.

## Available Workshops

Currently there are two workshops available:

* [Ansible Engine](ansible_engine/README.md)
* [Ansible Tower](ansible_tower/README.md)
